Removed files:

  The original upstream tarball contains some swf files, for which the
  source is present, but for which we miss the needed tools to build them
  from source.
  
  We therefore had to remove the following files from the upstream tarball:
  
  uifx/
  share/netmap/shell.swf
  share/netmap/shell.html (referencing shell.swf and otherwise emmpty)
  share/netmap/modules/gmap/
