        <h1>NagVis Geomap</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The NagVis Geomap map source was introduced in NagVis 1.7. It has been developed to get well rendered
        and scaled overview maps without much work.</p>
        <p>The geomap renders several hosts on an <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">Open Street Map</a> powered map which is used
        as background image.</p>
        <p>For the current geomap all you need is a CSV file which tells NagVis the hosts to render and
        the geo coordinates where the hosts should be positioned at.</p>

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>There is no special software needed on the NagVis host. But there is one special requirement. To
        be able to use this feature, NagVis needs to be able to access the host <code>geomap.nagvis.org</code>
        via port 80. NagVis uses a simple HTTP based API to get the map image and the coordinates of that image.</p>
        <p>In most cases the NagVis host does not have direct internet access. You can configure the <code>http_proxy</code>
        option in the <code>[global]</code> section of your NagVis main configuration to tell NagVis to use
        a proxy such requests. Most proxies require an authentication to control access to the internet.
        Please use the option <code>http_proxy_auth</code> to set the credentials.</p>
        
        <h2>The first call</h2>
        <p>NagVis comes with a demo geomap called "demo-geomap". If your NagVis is configured correctly
        you should see a map of germany with two nodes. One node is showing the host "ham-srv1" in Hamburg.
        The other host "muc-srv1" is located in Munich.</p>

        <p>The geomap is defined using the regular map configuration file "demo-geomap.cfg". The contents
        look like this:</p>
        
        <pre>global {
    sources=geomap
    alias=Demo: 4 Geomap
    parent_map=demo-overview
    iconset=std_medium
    backend_id=demo
    # Geomap Parameters
    source_type=csv
    source_file=demo-locations
    width=800
    height=600
}</pre>

        <p>The <code>sources=geomap</code> line tells the map to use the geomap source for altering the
        map configuration.

        The <code>source_type=csv</code> (<font color="#ff0000">new in 1.7.4</font>) line tells the geomap 
        source to use the CSV file defined in the 
        <code>source_file=demo-locations</code> definition located in the <code>etc/geomap</code> directory
        for gathering a list of hosts and coordinates to add to the geomap.</p>

        <p>The <code>demo-locations.csv</code> file contains the following two lines:</p>

        <pre>ham-srv1;Hamburg Server 1;53.556866;9.994622
muc-srv1;Munich Server1;48.1448353;11.5580067</pre>

        <p>Each line defines one host to be added to the map. The columns are separated by <code>;</code> signs.
        The first column contains the host-name, the second an optional alias, the third the LAT coordinate and
        the fourth the LONG coordinate.</p>
        <p><font color="red">(starting with git-version as of 2013-03-21)</font>: Lines starting with the usual comment characters
        (<code>;</code>, <code>#</code>, or <code>//</code>) are treated as comments.</p>

        <p><font color="#ff0000">New in 1.7.4</font>: It is also possible to set <code>source_type=backend</code>
        to use the backend set via <code>backend_id</code> to gather the list of hosts to be shown on the geomap
        and their coordinates. This is only possible when using the livestatus backend. It fetches all hosts
        from the backend and uses all hosts which have the custom object variables <code>_LAT</code> and
        <code>_LONG</code> configured. It is possible to filter the fetched hosts by the membership in a host group
        by setting the option <code>filter_group</code> to the name of the host group.</p>
        
        <h2>Configuring geomaps</h2>
        <p>The geomap source uses view parameters for configuration. For details take a look at the modify view
         dialog which can be opened using the header menu "Actions -> Modify view".</p>
        <p>The view parameters can also be given as map configuration attributes in the global section of the maps.</p>
