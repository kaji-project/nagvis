    <h1>Weathermap style lines in NagVis</h1>

    <p>By default NagVis can only visualize the normal states in lines using red, yellow
     and green coloured lines. Have you ever wanted NagVis to display nice weathermap style lines?</p>

    <h2>More colourful lines</h2>
    <img style="margin:20px;" src="../general/img/sample-weathermap.jpg" align="right" alt="NagVis Weathermap style lines" />
    <p>Since NagVis 1.5 it is possible to draw such weathermap style lines which
         can have more than three colours depending on the current load of e.g. the
         network interface you like to visualize. There can be a wide colour range
         of e.g. seven different colours. Take a look at the example image - isn't that beautiful?.</p>

    <h2>Weathermap line types</h2>
    <p>The weathermap style lines currently provide two types of lines:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>---%-->&lt;--%----</code>: Arrows with percentage labels in the middle of the line.</li>
        <li><code>---%+BW-->&lt;--%+BW---</code>: Arrows with percentage labels in the middle of the line and additional labels which display the current bandwidth usage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Focus on bandwidth visualization</h2>
    <p>The new lines are focused on bandwidth visualization. Since NagVis needs to parse the
     performance data to gather the current colour for the line there are special requirements
     on the performance data contents. There is a bandwidth measurement plugin for Nagios which
         comes with the correct performance data information out of the box. It is downloadable
         from <a href="http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Network-Connections%2C-Stats-and-Bandwidth/check_iftraffic3/details" target="_blank">Nagios Exchange</a>.</p>

    <h2>How to create weathermap lines?</h2>
    <p>To create weathermap style lines in NagVis you need services which send the correct
         performance data to Nagios. If you got some then simply place a line service object on the
         map and choose the correct line type. Now take a look at your map - it should work now.</p>

    <p>You may want to have a legend which shows you the meaning of the different colours.
         No problem. Simply add a shape to your map and choose the &quot;demo_traffic_load_legend&quot;
         shape which is delivered with the NagVis core package.</p>

    <h2>Needed perfdata format</h2>
    <p>The weathermap lines do not require a specific Nagios plugin. Only the provided performance
       format needs to match one of the cases below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Percentage usage:</strong> four perfdata sets. While the first two sets provide
            the percentage usage and the second two sets provide the usage in bytes per sec.<br />
              One example: <code>inUsage=21103.42%;85;98 outUsage=226363.55%;85;98 inBandwidth=105.52MBs
              outBandwidth=212.22MBs</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Byte rate usage:</strong> needs at least two perfdata sets with the labels &quot;in&quot;
            and &quot;out&quot; with an empty UOM. It uses the current value and the maximum value to calculate
                the current percentage usage. The current value should be given as byte rate. The maximum value
                should provide the network interface bandwidth as bytes per seconds.<br />
                One example: <code>in=7196.50566429;;;0;1250000.0 inucast=11.6273564992;;;; innucast=0.017617206817;;;; indisc=0.0;;;; inerr=0.0;0.01;0.1;; out=4044.9635368;;;0;1250000.0 outucast=12.1734899105;;;; outnucast=0.0;;;; outdisc=0.0;;;; outerr=0.0;0.01;0.1;; outqlen=0;;;;</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thanks to gjfrater for implementing these lines!</p>
